## ðŸŽ“ Lesson 1: What is an API?

### ðŸ”¹ General Definition

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a way for two software systems to communicate with each other.
It acts as a bridge or translator, allowing one program to request something from another and receive a response.

### ðŸ”¹ Simple Analogy

Think of a restaurant:

* You give your order to a waiter (this is like sending a request to an API)
* The waiter takes it to the kitchen (API sends it to the system)
* You receive your food (API sends the response back)

### ðŸ”¹ Why are APIs important?

* Allow systems to interact without knowing each otherâ€™s inner workings.
* Help developers build faster using external services (e.g., payment, weather, messaging).
* Enable powerful integrations between apps, services, and platforms.
