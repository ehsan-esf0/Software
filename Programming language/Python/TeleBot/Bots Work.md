# 🤖 How Telegram Bots Work 

When you create a Telegram bot, you receive a **bot token** — your bot’s personal key to interact with Telegram’s servers.

Here’s how the whole system works step by step:

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow

| 🔢 Step | 📌 Description                                                                   |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | A user sends a message to your bot.                                              |
| **2**   | Telegram receives the message and checks which bot it's for.                     |
| **3**   | Telegram sends the message to your bot **using either Webhook or Long Polling**. |
| **4**   | Your bot code processes the message and decides how to respond.                  |
| **5**   | Your bot sends a response back to the Telegram API using HTTPS.                  |

## ⚙️ Two Ways to Receive Messages

There are **two main ways** your bot can receive messages from Telegram:

---

### 🌐 1. Webhook (Push-based)

> Telegram **pushes** the message directly to your server when something happens.

✅ Real-time
✅ Efficient
❗ Requires an **HTTPS public server**

**How it works:**

* You register your webhook with Telegram by giving it your server URL.
* Telegram sends an HTTP POST request to that URL **whenever a new message comes in**.
* Your server handles the request and replies accordingly.

🧩 Example:

```bash
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/setWebhook?url=https://yourdomain.com/bot
```

---

### 🔁 2. Long Polling (Pull-based)

> Your bot **keeps asking** Telegram: "Any new messages?"

✅ Easy to set up
✅ Works **without public servers**
❗ Less efficient for big projects

**How it works:**

* Your bot continuously sends requests to Telegram’s `/getUpdates` endpoint.
* If a new message is available, Telegram returns it.
* After handling it, your bot sends another request and the loop continues.

🧩 Example (Python pseudocode):

```python
while True:
    updates = get_updates()
    handle(updates)
```

## 🆚 Webhook vs. Long Polling

| Feature              | 🔁 Long Polling                   | 🌐 Webhook                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Setup**            | Easy (works locally)              | Needs HTTPS server           |
| **Message Delivery** | Your bot pulls from Telegram      | Telegram pushes to your bot  |
| **Speed**            | Slight delay                      | Real-time / instant          |
| **Efficiency**       | Less efficient (constant polling) | More efficient (event-based) |
| **Best For**         | Learning, testing, small bots     | Production, scalable apps    |
| **Security**         | No SSL required                   | SSL (HTTPS) required         |

## 🧠 Simple Analogy

* **Webhook** = Like someone calling you **only when they need you**
* **Long Polling** = Like you **calling them every few seconds** to ask if they need something

## 💡 When Should You Use Each?

| Scenario                             | Use This        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| You're testing on your own computer  | 🔁 Long Polling |
| You're building a professional bot   | 🌐 Webhook      |
| You don’t have a public HTTPS server | 🔁 Long Polling |
| You want the fastest delivery time   | 🌐 Webhook      |
