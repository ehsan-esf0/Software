## 🔄 Full Communication Cycle Between User, Telegram, and Your Bot (Using Webhook)

---

### 🟢 **Step 0: Set the Webhook**

Before anything happens, you tell Telegram where your bot is located by calling this API:

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://yourdomain.com/webhook
```

Telegram now knows where to send incoming messages for your bot.

---

### 🟡 **Step 1: A User Sends a Message to Your Bot**

For example, the user writes:

```
/start
```

or:

```
Hi!
```

---

### 🟠 **Step 2: Telegram Receives the Message**

Telegram receives and processes the message.

Since your bot has a webhook registered, Telegram knows it should forward this message to your server.

---

### 🔵 **Step 3: Telegram Sends an HTTP POST Request to Your Server**

Telegram sends a `POST` request to your webhook URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/webhook`) with a JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "update_id": 123456789,
  "message": {
    "message_id": 42,
    "from": {
      "id": 123456789,
      "first_name": "Ali",
      "username": "ali_user"
    },
    "chat": {
      "id": 123456789,
      "type": "private"
    },
    "text": "Hi!"
  }
}
```

---

### 🟣 **Step 4: Your Server Receives and Processes the Message**

Your backend logic reads and analyzes the incoming JSON:

```python
data = request.json
text = data['message']['text']
chat_id = data['message']['chat']['id']
```

---

### 🟤 **Step 5: Your Server Sends an HTTP Response Back to Telegram**

This response is **only for Telegram**, not for the user. It tells Telegram:

> “Yes, I received the message successfully.”

Example:

```python
return "OK", 200
```

> If your server doesn’t respond in time or responds with an error, Telegram may retry sending the message.

---

### ⚫ **Step 6: Your Server Sends a Message Back to the User via Telegram API**

To reply to the **user**, your server must send a **new API request** to Telegram:

```python
import requests

requests.post(f"https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/sendMessage", json={
    "chat_id": chat_id,
    "text": f"You said: {text}"
})
```

---

### 🔴 **Step 7: Telegram Delivers Your Message to the User**

Telegram receives your `sendMessage` API call, processes it, and displays your response in the user’s chat.
